        <img class="in" src="images/publisher_on.png">
        <span class="title">Open a publisher account</span>
        <span class="no">1.</span>
        <span class="desc">Once you have an <a href="http://cleeng.com/publisher-registration/">account created</a> you can setup a Publisher Token. With this Token you identify yourself in step 2. </span>

        <img class="out" src="images/afterpur.png">
        <img class="in" src="images/beforepur.png">
        <span class="title">Create an offer and put it online</span>
        <span class="no">2.</span>
        <span class="desc">
            You can protect your content, define the offer price and conditions (like rental or subscription) and embed this offer on your website. We have turn-key plugins available to do this for you, but for full flexibility check the tutorials. All that matters is the offer ID.

    <div class="intr-box" style="top:60px; left: 640px; z-index: 100">

        <span class="no">3.</span>
        <span class="desc">
            With some simple JavaScript based on jQuery you can trigger the purchase. While the original web-page stays in-tact, the visitor pays securely on the Cleeng servers and validates access. A secure Customer Token is passed to you (and stored as cookie).
